    By default, the code check if the file is successfully opened by some application immediately
    after the subprocess is spawn. If yes, return the `Popen` object (which can access stdout &

    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath : str or path-like
        The path to the file.
    wait : int
        How many second to wait before we check if the file is opened successfully

    Returns
    -------
    subprocess.Popen
        Note: the `poll()` method is already called once.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        When `xdg-open` return following error codes: 1, 3, and 4.
    FileNotFoundError
        When `xdg-open` returns error code 2.
