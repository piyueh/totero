class DocumentItem(_AttrMap):
    """A row item that represents one document in Zotero.

    One single line widget that can control what column to show.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : dict or pandas.Series
        The raw data of a document with brief info. The provided `dict`/`pandas.Series` should have
        at least the indices requested by `columns`.
    columns : list of str, or None
        The columns to be shown when rendered. The keys in `columns` should be valid keys or column
        names of the `data`. If `None`, use all keys (except attachments) from `data`.
    weights : list of int, or None
        The weights of the column widths. If None, assume all column widths are the same. If
        `weights` is provided, it should have the same langth as the `columns`.
    wrap : str
        The `wrap` argument in a `urwid.Text` widget. Whether the texts insides columns should be
        wrapped if longer than the column widths.

    Notes
    -----
    1. The underlying widget is `urwid.Column` with selectable `uriwd.Text`s. Because of
       `urwid.Text`, the sizing mode of this widget is `flow` type.

    2. Original data provided are saved, even some of them may not be used in rendering. Then when
       we want to adjust the columns being rendered, we don't have to create new instances.

    3. Because of the `urwid.Text`, users have to make sure the data can be converted to `str`.

    4. If the key `"attachment path"` is provided in `data`, and its value is a list of
       paths/strings:

        a. If length of this list >= 2, when key in "enter", a window pops up and allows users to
           choose which attachment to open.
        b. If length of this list == 1, when key in "enter", the attachment will be opened with
           `xdg-open`
        c. If it is an empty list, nothing happens.

    5. If the value to `"attachment path"` is a single str/path, then it's the same as providing a
       length-one list.

    6. To enable the attachment selection pop-up, the major render loop `urwid.MainLoop` should
       have the `pop_ups` argument enabled.

    7. Color palette:
        a. Set `"normal doc"` for a widget not on focus; alternatively, set this widget's attribute
           `_normal_ctag` to change the tag from `"normal doc"` to another tag.
        b. Set `"selected doc"` for a widget on focus; alternatively, set this widget's attribute
           `_focus_ctag` to change the tag from `"selected doc"` to another tag.

    >>> item2 = {
            "author": "Def et al.",
            "year": 2019,
            "title": "An example document 2",

        }
    >>> doc1 = DocumentItem(item1, ["author", "title", "publication", "year"], [20, 100, 30, 6])
    >>> doc2 = DocumentItem(item2, ["author", "title", "publication", "year"], [20, 100, 30, 6])
    >>> colors = [
            ("normal doc", "white", "black", None, None, None),
            ("selected doc", "black", "yellow", None, None, None),
            ("normal button", "white", "black", None, None, None),

            ("attachment win title", "light red,bold,italics", "black", None, None, None),
        ]
    >>> loop = MainLoop(ListBox(SimpleFocusListWalker([doc1, doc2])), colors, pop_ups=True)
    >>> loop.run()

    Use the arrow keys (up & down, or any custom keys that map to up and down) to select a different
    document and "enter" to open the attachment selection pop-up.
